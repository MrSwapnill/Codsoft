              1. *Invoice Management*: Forms for creating new invoices, displaying existing invoices, and updating invoice details.<br>
              2. *Client Information*: Sections for storing and managing client details such as name, address, and contact information.<br>
              3. *Payment Tracking*: Features for recording payments made against invoices and tracking outstanding balances.<br>
              4. *Dashboard*: Summary view displaying key metrics like total revenue, outstanding payments, and recent activity.<br>
              5. *Responsive Design*: Ensuring the interface is optimized for various screen sizes and devices using CSS media queries.<br>
              6. *User-Friendly Layout*: Organizing elements intuitively and using clear labels and instructions for easy navigation.<br>
              
              By combining HTML for structure and CSS for styling, the billing system can provide a user-friendly interface for managing billing-related tasks efficiently.</p>
